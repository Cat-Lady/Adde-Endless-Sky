#### This is a fork for personal use, that at the moment just removes wormhole to all-content area. In future, it might also integrate stuff from my plugins or "ES: Captain's Edition", where approriate.

## Adde Endless Sky
## Adde Master
This branch is the master branch, which contains all Adde content from all other branches joined as one. Please note that the master branch does include Omnis as it is one of the repository branches, so if you are meaning to play a legitimate game you should stay away from the wormhole in Rutilicus.
