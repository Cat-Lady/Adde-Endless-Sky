			`On the descent down into the crater, the great shimmering spire at the center of it all casts an intense glare in all directions. The beautiful sight of the city surrounding the spire puts you in awe, the buildings are all well maintained, with ease of access by air, or ground. The swarming layers of hover vehicles above it all is incredible, they must run autonomously as they all traverse the airspace fluidly and with very little room for error.`
			`	The only active comms channel only offers repeating instructions on where to land depending on what classification you qualify, 14A for visiting parties. Upon landing your ship within the hangar, a party of four approach your ship, what appears at first glance to be naked human men. On closer inspection it's clear that these humanoids bear no obvious reproductive organs, and a flat stretch of skin where a nose would normally sit, additionally, none of these humanoids have any hair across their bodies.`
			`	As they draw nearer you notice that the two adjacent to the center individual bear an unusual build, it seems they are wearing body armor designed to blend in with the others. The last appears to be female, or at least a separate breed of the species that is very slim, at least a head taller than the others and the ears stretch to a point, Much like a mythical race from old legends. She holds an electronic device likely for keeping a transcript of the conversation, "Wonderful day isn't it sir, or ma'am of course." the spokesperson opens with, he sounds almost cautious when pronouncing.`
			choice
				`	"You know how to speak to me?"`
				`	"How are we understanding each other"`
			`	He plainly explains, as if it were procedure, "We have met travelers from your people before, they were kind to lend us multiple databases of text and literature in your native tongue." he tries to find a way to phrase as to not lead in circles, "We are a modest race, we can not rule over others or live in peace with the feeble tools we have. So to gain power as other great civilizations have, we adapt the tools of others for our use. Many oblige us with their favor, we have received a great many deliveries of new and exotic technology, and they of course get their return, we pay generously so that we may reach great heights in time."`
			choice
				`	"What do you mean travelers? You've met us before?"`
				`	"Well I could see what I could find for you on my travels."`
					goto register
			`	"Yes, many cycles ago we were visited by your green skinned brethren; they frequently brought us what we desired so that we may finance their campaign, of which they did not share with us."`
			choice
				`	"You shouldn't trade with the Alphas! They betrayed us to control us, we barely fought them off!"`
				`	"The Alphas are dangerous and you shouldn't trust them."`
			`	"I apologize greatly for distressing you; but we had no way of knowing, any information about your kind they brought us had no mention of any recent war between the skins." he says, surprisingly sympathetic for you. He further explains, "They brought us much technology; more than we had hoped from them and we made discoveries far beyond what we had imagined."`
			`	"We apologize greatly for placing your people in such danger, unfortunately we have no information about their whereabouts, for they arrived using technology that they explicitly refused to sell. They have long since disappeared and now provide us nothing, we have reached heights we previously thought impossible because of our partnership with the green skinned humans. If you are still willing, we would partner with you and help you, if you help us."`
			choice
				`	"I can see what I can bring back here."`
					goto register
				`	"I'm not sure I can do business with you."`
					decline
			label register
			`	"That's very good news! I'll just need some more information for your record." He then proceeds to take an extraordinarily long time to go over the exact specifications of your ship and makes conversation about what lies outside of their space. Finally he looks to the scribe and then back, "We should have everything we need for the documents, now just to inform you of our operating procedure regarding brought technology."`
			`	"As I had explained earlier, we pay very generously, for the right technology it could make you a very wealthy human. When you bring new technology to us to sell, we require a set of two of whatever technology you bring to us. Our engineers will spend some time looking over them to determine the value of the items to us and that will be the final price." he says, putting on a slightly sterner voice than before that you notice.`
			`	He continues, rebounding back to his calm and predisposed manner of speaking; "Another kindness we allow is the freedom of choice. If you are not comfortable with the payment we offer you aren't made to accept it, you are free to decline the trade if you so wish." As he turns to walk away he hesitates, as if forgetting something important, "Oh of course I never told you my designation, I'm Saed, or at the very least it's the closest translation for humans." he then turns back and continues on his way out.`

As the projection of the map flickers on you notice that Aben space is already highlighted in a faint neon blue. "So here is our space, you were already provided with this knowledge, and this.." he draws his finger towards Hai space, which you have filled in on the map, "That's the Hai, they are peaceful for the most part. However forced to maintain a heavy military presence to hold back the warlike Hai at their border system." you interrupt, however he does not seem phased by the interruption so much as he is intrigued by the Hai. "This is exciting, I'd require your in-depth report of your findings about these Hai, and what else surrounds us." he follows up with questions on the rest of your findings, however phased by your description of the scarred and brown hulks towards the galactic core.`
			`	"Thank you greatly for your efforts, these Hai leave me optimistic of a future of peace but those soulless vessels on the other side of us worry me." you reassure him that those drones don't have the ability to travel beyond hyperspace links.

We now see that it is foolish to remain blind to what dangers lurk out of sight, for we may not know to prepare for an enemy we do not anticipate."`

He then highlights the areas that they are interested in collecting data for, "We require basic scans of the systems closest to our space, and records of system traffic.
